        <section>
            <p>The history of flatbread can be traced back to the Viking Age, a time of great conquest and adventure. This simple bread is made from a mixture of rye flour, water, salt, and sometimes yeast or sourdough starter, which is then rolled out thin and baked at a temperature to rival the forge of mjollinir. I recall how our warriors needed food that could withstand the rigors of long journeys and expeditions. The dry and hard texture of the bread made it ideal for storage and transportation.</p>
            
            <p>As time passed, it became a staple source of sustanance, often served with butter, cheese, or other toppings as a snack or part of a meal. But as a god of wisdom and knowledge, I am here to report there are now variations that incorporate new ingredients.  Such as this recipe which includes birch bark, borrowed from the Sami people of northern Lapland, which adds additional nutritional value to the bread. It is satisfying to see how this ancient bread has evolved and adapted over time, while still maintaining its importance in everyday cuisine.</p>
