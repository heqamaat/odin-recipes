        <section>
            <p>The history of this flatbread can be traced back to the Viking Age.  It was a time of conquest. It was a time of adventure.  It was a time when our warriors needed simple sustanance such that it could keep on on our feet and allow us to withstand the rigors of long expeditions.  A bread rolled thin and baked flat at a temperature to rival the forge of mjollinir is a dry and hard bread ideal for storage and transportation.</p>

            <p>It is fascinating to see how the ancient bread has endured, while still maintaining its importance in everyday cuisine. Nowawdays it s a staple more often served with butter or cheese rather than making up a whole meal in and of itself. The version before you today incorporates birch bark, a variation borrowed from the Sami people of Lapland. Our northern brethern knew how to extract nutrition from the most unlikely of sources and I present it here for you to enjoy now.</p>
