            <p>I have fond memories of elderberry soup, a sweet and delectably treat to be savored as a chilled dessert on the hottest days of summer, as well as a warming comfort through the famed long nights of winter. I dare day it could even fend off the biting chill of Niflheim.</p>

            <p>A dish that continues its popularity throughout Europe to this very day, elderberry soup is sweet and tangy and not only tantalizes the palette but offers a sweeping variety of health benefits. It is rich in something called antioxidants, and I am told that is something you humans care about very much. The venerable goddess Eir also purports that such protection against such ailments as colds, the flu and inflammation. Its sumptuous flavor will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression, which is why you should proceed to make it with the utmost haste.</p>
